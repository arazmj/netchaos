# NetChaos

**NetChaos** is a Kubernetes-native network fault injection framework for chaos testing and resilience validation. It leverages **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** and **eBPF** to simulate network conditions such as packet drops, latency, and protocol-specific disruptions at the node level.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîß **Custom CRDs** to define network faults in a declarative way
- üß† **eBPF-based packet processing** (via XDP or tc) for high-performance, kernel-level fault injection
- üéØ Target specific pods, protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), or ports
- ‚è± Delay or drop packets based on rule logic (sequence number, percentage, etc.)
- üîí Runs with minimal privileges, confined by Kubernetes RBAC and node capabilities

---

## üß© Use Cases

- Chaos testing for Kubernetes apps and services
- Validating retry logic, timeouts, and fallbacks
- Simulating flaky networks in CI/CD
- Fault injection in service mesh or microservice environments

---

## üì¶ Example CRD

```yaml
apiVersion: nettools.io/v1alpha1
kind: FaultInjection
metadata:
  name: icmp-dropper
spec:
  target:
    namespace: default
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
  protocol: ICMP
  action: DROP
  match:
    seqMod: 5
```
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.23.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/netchaos:tag
```


**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don‚Äôt work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/netchaos:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/netchaos:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/netchaos/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

# netchaos

## Prerequisites

1. stable rust toolchains: `rustup toolchain install stable`
1. nightly rust toolchains: `rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src`
1. (if cross-compiling) rustup target: `rustup target add ${ARCH}-unknown-linux-musl`
1. (if cross-compiling) LLVM: (e.g.) `brew install llvm` (on macOS)
1. (if cross-compiling) C toolchain: (e.g.) [`brew install filosottile/musl-cross/musl-cross`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/homebrew-musl-cross) (on macOS)
1. bpf-linker: `cargo install bpf-linker` (`--no-default-features` on macOS)

## Build & Run

Use `cargo build`, `cargo check`, etc. as normal. Run your program with:

```shell
cargo run --release --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E"'
```

Cargo build scripts are used to automatically build the eBPF correctly and include it in the
program.

## Cross-compiling on macOS

Cross compilation should work on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

```shell
CC=${ARCH}-linux-musl-gcc cargo build --package netchaos --release \
  --target=${ARCH}-unknown-linux-musl \
  --config=target.${ARCH}-unknown-linux-musl.linker=\"${ARCH}-linux-musl-gcc\"
```
The cross-compiled program `target/${ARCH}-unknown-linux-musl/release/netchaos` can be
copied to a Linux server or VM and run there.

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
